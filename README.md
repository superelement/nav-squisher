# nav-squisher
Give your global header a bit more room to breath with this nav compacting tool

## Description
Often you have limited space in a website's global header and need to squeeze in a sizable first-level navigation. 
Large desktops probably have plenty of space for your nav, but tablets (especially portrait) and laptops just can't fit it all in.
You want the spacing left & right of each button's text to be consistant (as if you were using `display:inline-block`, or `float:left`), but you don't want it to wrap to the next line.
You don't mind the text contents of some buttons flowing onto multiple lines (given a `max-width` property), if it helps keep the nav, as a whole, on 1 line. It's preferrable to text overflow truncation.
"Nav Squisher" is what you need!
